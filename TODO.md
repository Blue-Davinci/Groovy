# Project TODOs

This document outlines the tasks and features that are planned or need to be implemented in the project.

## Frontend

- **Improve User Interface:** The current frontend is functional but could benefit from a more modern and user-friendly design. This could include better form validation, more intuitive navigation, and a more visually appealing color scheme and layout.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the frontend is fully responsive and provides a good user experience on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

## Backend

- **Testing:** Implement more comprehensive tests for the backend including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the backend for better performance. Maybe optimizing database queries, implementing caching, and reducing memory usage.

## General

- **Code Quality:** Continually improve the quality of the code by refactoring where necessary, removing unused code, and adhering to best practices.
- **Dockerization:** Containerize the API
